## 2. Progressive Hint Prompting (PHP)

### 2.1 Method Adjustments

Four versions were evaluated, with accuracy results as follows:

| Version | Zero-shot | Few-shot | Logic Mod 1: Long Output → Prompt Revision | Logic Mod 2: Format Issue → Prompt Format Correction | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1      | ✓         |          |                                            |                                                      | 19.48%   |
| 2      |           | ✓        |                                            |                                                      | 38.47%   |
| 3      |           | ✓        | ✓                                          |                                                      | 35.20%   |
| 4      |           | ✓        |                                            | ✓                                                    | 50.50%   |

**Notes:**  
- **Version 1**: Pure Zero-shot.  
- **Version 2**: Pure Few-shot.  
- **Version 3**: Adds logic to detect overly long outputs and prompt revision.  
- **Version 4**: Replaces length-based detection with format-aware error detection—if output is long but well-structured, it’s accepted; only malformed long outputs trigger correction. This yields the best accuracy (50.50%).

### 2.2 Hyperparameter Tuning (Based on Version 4)

#### 2.2.1 Temperature Adjustment

| Temperature | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| 0.1         | 50.50%   |

| 0.3         | 52.90%   |
| 0.4         | 51.55%   |
| 0.5         | 53.53%   |
| 0.6         | 51.29%   |

→ **Selected temperature: 0.5** (highest accuracy).

### 2.3 Best-Performing Configuration Metrics

| Metric Category           | Value                     |

## 3. Program-of-Thoughts (PoT)

### 3.1 Method Adjustments (Evaluated on 200-sample dev set)

| Version | Zero-shot | Few-shot | Add Code Shot | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
| 1      | ✓         |          |               | 42.50%   |
| 2      |           | ✓        |               | 32.00%   |
| 3      |           | ✓        | ✓             | 25.50%   |

**Insight**:  
Zero-shot outperforms Few-shot and Code-shot variants. This suggests the model is not optimized for code-based reasoning, and additional examples or code prompts harm performance.

### 3.2 Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 3.2.1 Temperature Adjustment

| Temperature | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| 0.1         | 41.4%    |

## 4. Hybrid PoT-PHP Method

### 4.1 Core Principle and Performance Metrics

**Hybrid PoT-PHP** employs an intelligent two-stage strategy:  
1. **First attempt**: Use **Program-of-Thoughts (PoT)** for fast, structured reasoning.  
2. **Fallback**: If PoT fails, apply **Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP)** for iterative self-correction.  

Dynamic hyperparameters are used per method (PoT at temp=0.2, PHP at temp=0.5).

| Metric Category           | Value                     |

| Accuracy                  | 65.28%                    |
| Total Time                | 3,407.65 seconds (~56.8 min) |
| Avg. Time per Question    | 2.58 seconds/question     |
| Total Token Consumption   | 936,023                   |
| Avg. Tokens per Question  | 709.65                    |
