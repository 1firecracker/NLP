{"question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?", "ground_truth": 3, "predicted_answer": 3, "response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much white fiber is used. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:\n\nHalf as much white fiber as 2 bolts of blue fiber = 2 bolts * 1/2 = 1 bolt\n\nNow that we know the amount of blue and white fiber used, we can add them together to find the total number of bolts needed:\n\nTotal bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts\n\n#### 3", "token_stats": {"prompt_tokens": 81, "completion_tokens": 134, "total_tokens": 215}, "correct": true, "processing_time": 2.678023099899292, "error": null}
