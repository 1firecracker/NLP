She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = <<16-3=13>>13 eggs left.\nShe sells each of the remaining 13 eggs for $2. So she makes 13 * $2 = <<13*2=26>>26 dollars every day at the farmers' market.\n#### 26", "token_stats": {"prompt_tokens": 1024, "completion_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 1124}, "correct": false}
